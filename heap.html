    <h1>Course Learning Reflection</h1>
    <p>This page contains my reflections on the course. Here's what I learned:</p>

    <!-- Heap Sort Section -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Heap Sort</h2>
        <p>Heap Sort first builds a heap from the input array and then repeatedly extracts the maximum (or minimum) element, rebuilding the heap each time, to produce a sorted array.</p>
        <pre class="code">
ALGORITHM HeapBottomUp(H[1..n])
for i ← n / 2 downto 1 do
    k ← i
    v ← H[k]
    heap ← false
    while not heap and 2 * k <= n do
        j ← 2 * k
        if j < n
            if H[j] < H[j + 1]
                j ← j + 1
        if v >= H[j]
            heap ← true
        else
            H[k] ← H[j]
            k ← j
    H[k] ← v
        </pre>

    <!-- Heap - Short and Simple Explanation -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Heap - Short and Simple Explanation</h2>
        <p>A <strong>heap</strong> is a special tree structure where every parent node follows a rule:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In a <strong>max-heap</strong>, the parent’s value is always greater than its children.</li>
            <li>In a <strong>min-heap</strong>, the parent’s value is always smaller than its children.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Heaps are mostly used in <strong>priority queues</strong> and <strong>heap sort</strong>.</p>

        <h3>Challenges in Understanding and Learning:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Heap Property:</strong> Grasping the difference between max-heap and min-heap can be confusing.</li>
            <li><strong>Insertion/Deletion:</strong> These operations need balancing the tree, which involves moving elements around, and that can be tricky.</li>
            <li><strong>Array Representation:</strong> Heaps are often stored in arrays instead of traditional tree structures, which can confuse how elements are organized.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Challenges in Real-World Applications:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Memory Usage:</strong> Storing heaps in arrays can take more space, which might be inefficient in resource-limited environments.</li>
            <li><strong>Complexity:</strong> When the data keeps changing rapidly, managing the heap efficiently can become tough.</li>
            <li><strong>Imbalance:</strong> If not carefully managed, heaps can become unbalanced, leading to slower operations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How to Choose the Most Efficient Approach:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Problem Type:</strong> Use heaps when you need quick access to the largest or smallest element (like in priority queues).</li>
            <li><strong>Space vs. Time:</strong> If memory is a concern, consider other data structures. Heaps are time-efficient but can be memory-heavy.</li>
            <li><strong>Other Structures:</strong> For certain tasks, balanced trees or arrays might work better than heaps.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p><strong>Heap</strong> is great for tasks like priority queues but can be tricky to learn and use efficiently. Consider your problem carefully to decide if a heap is the best choice.</p>
